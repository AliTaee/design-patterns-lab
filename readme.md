### Factory pattern

With the factory pattern we can use factory functions in order to create new objects. A function is a factory function when it returns a new object without the use of the new keyword!
The factory pattern is useful when we have to create multiple smaller objects that share the same properties. A factory function can easily return a custom object depending on the current environment, or user-specific configuration.
